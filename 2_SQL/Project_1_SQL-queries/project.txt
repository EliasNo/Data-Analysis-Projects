/* SUBMISSION of four questions to udacity course,
includes
1. 4 queries that runs without errors
2. All queries includes neccessary JOINS
3. Each query includes aggregations such as COUNT or NTILE
4. Two queries have CTE, two queries have subqueries
5. Three out of four queries uses window functions such as COUNT over or NTILE over
6. All SQL queries are aliased appropriately
7. See presentation in attached PDF


/*### Question 1 - Which movies are families watching? */

/* CTE to do the counting */

/* ### Question 2 - What are the length for the movies families are wtaching */

/* CTE to do the quantiles */

/*### Question 3 - How long movies do family watch for each category?*/

/* Including subquery where the quartiles are calculated */

SELECT name, standard_quantile, COUNT(*) AS count

ORDER BY name,standard_quantile,count;


/* ### Question 4 - How much do each store rent out per month/year*/

/* Including subquery where the month and date are extracted */

SELECT Rental_month,
	   Rental_year,
	   st.store_id,
	   COUNT(*) AS COUNT
FROM(SELECT
	   staff_id,
